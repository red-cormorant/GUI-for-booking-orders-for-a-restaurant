# GUI-for-booking-orders-for-a-restaurant
I developed a database for a restaurant which mananges bookings and orders made by a client, so all the records are being written as data accesible trough GUI. The user can view and edit information using SQL queries. For this project I used SQL and Microsoft SQL Server for the database, Java, JavaFX along with Scene Builder for the GUI.
